// Using a well thought out state tree and nested component structure, construct an application that rolls a die and keeps track of the numbers rolled. Here is a wireframe to help you start planning your application:

// //As a user, I can see an application called Dice Roller
// // As a developer, I can create a React application with App.js as my stateful component

//As a developer, I can create two child components that will accept props from App.js
// As a user, I can click a box and see the outcome of my current "roll"
// As a developer, I can pass a method from App.js to my dice component to display a number between 1 and 6
// As a user, I can see my roll logged
// As a developer, I can pass the value of the roll to a log component
// As a user, I can see the roll log continue to grow as I roll the dice

//1.Do last? App.css: wireframe image on syllubus for formating example- Use Vicente's box code
//2. Create State Tree
// 3. Create nested component structure
// 4. Parent: is App.js This is an application that rolls a die
// 5. Child: A component that keeps track of the numbers rolled
// 6. Put the name of app "Dice Roller" so that it appears in web browser put code in App.js
// 7. In App.js create a react app, as the state
// 8. Make 2 child components that will accept props from App.js
//    Component Child 1-"DiceGambler"
//    Component Child 2-"DiceTracker"
// 9. Add a button with an onClick, that shows outcome of current "roller"
// 10. Add to existing method in App.js, pass this from parent to child component Child 1
// 11. Display roll logged in Web browser
// 12. In the Component Child 2-"DiceTracker", display log the previous rolls
// 13. In the Component Child 2-"DiceTracker", display log that continues to track rolls each time the dice is rolled.
